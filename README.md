## Code used for comparison between AALpy's and LeanLib

Comparison is performed on random models of increasing size and on random models of fixed size with an increasing input alphabet.
All random models are generated with LearnLib, and then loaded with AALpy.
In addition, we compare performance on 4 benchmarks models from "https://automata.cs.ru.nl/".

- Learnlib code is found in `the src/main/java/Learner.java`
- AAlpy's code is found in `learnlib_comparison.py`
